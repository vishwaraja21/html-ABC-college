        <p>Economics at Saveetha Engineering College provides a thorough understanding of economic principles and their application in the real world. The curriculum covers microeconomics, which focuses on individual and firm behavior, and macroeconomics, which examines national and global economic systems. Students learn about market dynamics, resource allocation, and economic policy-making. Courses in econometrics and statistical analysis equip students with the skills to analyze economic data and make informed decisions. The program also explores development economics, international trade, and public finance, broadening students' perspectives on economic issues. Through case studies and projects, students apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, preparing them for careers in finance, government, consulting, and academia.</p>
